Change to capitalize Get/Set defaults
Change to use _ for hidden instead of custom prefix. Should sets be hidden by default unless exposed? Gets probably should be exposed so I'm leaning towards exposing sets as well

Add tests/test support (see memedit?)
Add dynamic scanning capabilities for all accessible memory (see memedit scan/scanner)
	Include negate scans
	Include value changed scans?
